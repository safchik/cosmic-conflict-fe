# Cosmic Conflict

## Welcome to Cosmic Conflict!

In this front end you'll be able to run the app on an ios or android emulator through React Native Expo.
In there you can experience our game which allows for signing up and logging in, whilst you're connected to our host api.

You can create either a human or an alien character who will receive a 20% boost in defence or attack respectively.
Then you'll be able to see a list of other users to attack, the higher your attack when compared to the targeted user's defence, the more likely you'll win.
But there's still an element of randomness to keep things interesting!
After attacking, if successful, you'll receive 80% of the victim's credits

Each hour you'll earn some credits, which you can spend on new items to upgrade your attack and defence stats.
You'll also notice a section of the shop for healing items which may be implemented in the future.


### Thank you for checking out our group project!
